                of the
                Mississippi
                River in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of
                the
                festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music
                and
                dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An
                account
                from
                1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in
                the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever
                such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville,
                a
                rich
                plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.

                became president of the association in 2004.[4] After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans
                following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted
                for months afterward.
